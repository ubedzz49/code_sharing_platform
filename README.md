This Collaborative Code-Sharing Platform is a Django-based web application designed to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among developers. Users can submit their 
solutions to coding problems, share detailed explanations, and link to relevant coding challenges. The platform supports a real-time chat feature, allowing users to discuss 
solutions, provide feedback, and collaborate on improving code. With a built-in authentication system, users can securely log in, submit their solutions, and participate in discussions.
This platform aims to create a supportive environment where developers of all skill levels can learn, share, and grow together by working on coding problems and exploring diverse solutions.
